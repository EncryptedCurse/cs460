## Robots

Exploration of...

* Three.js skeletons and textures
* Body movement
* Collision and boundary detection
* JavaScript prototypes
* HTML video and audio contexts

Hold the shift key and click anywhere on the platform to create new robots.

The robots can...
* avoid collision with each other and the stationary obstacle
* walk away from the plane's boundaries to prevent falling off
* dance!
